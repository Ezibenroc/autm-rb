My first steps in CS were at the [Université Joseph Fourier](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en),
where I studied for two years mathematics, computer science and a bit of physics.

Then, I went to the [CS department](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/?lang=en) of the
[ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.eu/ens-de-lyon-accueil-gb-78426.kjsp?RH=ENS-LYON-FR)
(a.k.a. École Normale Supérieure de Lyon). I studied for two years theoretical
computer science, following a curriculum driven by and for research. I got a BSc
degree in computer science, with great honors, and did the first year of a MSc in
computer science.

Now, I am pursuing a MSc degree in computer science at [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/)
(a.k.a. Superior National School of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science).
I am specializing in [Information Systems Engineering](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/curriculum/information-systems-engineering-240318.kjsp?RH=1228477151490).
