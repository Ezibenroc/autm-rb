My first steps in CS were at the [Université Joseph Fourier](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en),
where I studied for two years mathematics, computer science and a bit of physics.

Then, I went to the [CS department](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/?lang=en) of the
[École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.eu/ens-de-lyon-accueil-gb-78426.kjsp?RH=ENS-LYON-FR),
where I studied for two years theoretical computer science, following a curriculum
driven by and for research. I got a BSc, with great honors, and did the first year
of my MSc.
