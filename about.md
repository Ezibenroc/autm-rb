## Education

I am pursuing an engineering degree in computer science at [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/)
(a.k.a. Superior National School of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, a
school from the [Grenoble Institude of Technology](http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/grenoble-institute-of-technology-9224.kjsp)).
I am specializing in [Information Systems Engineering](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/curriculum/information-systems-engineering-240318.kjsp?RH=1228477151490).

Before, I studied theoretical computer science at the [CS department](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/?lang=en)
of the [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.eu/ens-de-lyon-accueil-gb-78426.kjsp?RH=ENS-LYON-FR)
(a.k.a. École Normale Supérieure de Lyon).


## Experience

As you may guess from my experience, I love research.

During summer 2015, I did a R&D internship at Bull, about the isolation of jobs
in supercomputers. The aim was to design and implement algorithms to prevent the
leak of any sensible information.

Previously, during summers 2012, 2013 and 2014, I worked in University Laboratories,
mainly about monitoring and verification. The 2013 internship [resulted in a publication](/publications#forte14).


I also love [software projects](/projects)!

My biggest achievement is certainly [Platypus](/projects#platypus), a
tool which answers to questions like “[What are the birth dates of the daughters of Marie Curie?](http://askplatyp.us/?lang=en&q=What+are+the+birth+dates+of+the+daughters+of+Marie+Curie%3F)”.
I worked on the “question parsing” module, which transforms a question into some
well structured object, handleable by the other backend modules.


## Hobbies

This is a bit cliché for a Grenoble inhabitant, a city surrounded by mountains and
considered as the capital of French Alps, but I love skiing and climbing!

I also love to contemplate submarine life. I am an adept of free diving since many
years, and I recently began to practice scuba diving.
